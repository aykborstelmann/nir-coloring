\section{Dataset}
While examining both proposed methods for their suitability for near-infrared colorization multiple datasets 
and two data sources were used \textit{Caltech Camera Traps} and \textit{Snapshot Serengeti} due to advantages 
and disadvantages of those. 

\subsection{Caltech Camera Traps}
\textit{Caltech Camera Traps} (CCT) is a dataset consisting of $243.100$ images from $140$ camera locations 
in the southwestern united states with $21$ animal label categories \cite{caltech}. 
In particular, it also contains near-infrared images mostly at night and regular RGB images in the daytime. 
Approximately $70 \%$ of the overall image set is labeled as empty. 
Annotations are provided in the \textit{COCO Camera Traps} format describing meta information via JSON \cite{caltech}
This allows an automatic parsing of the available images as well as efficient access to information about 
the images which comes in useful when creating sub-datasets for training networks.
Unfortunately, the COCO format does not provide information on whether the image is an RGB- or a NIR image. 

\subsection{Snapshot Serengeti}
In contrast to the CCT dataset, \textit{Snapshot Serengeti} is a much larger dataset and comes from the Snapshot Serengeti National Park in Tanzania.
It consists of $7.1$ million images through seven seasons of the Snapshot Serengeti Project \cite{serengeti}. 
There are $61$ labeled species where as approximately $76\%$ of the images are labeled as empty. 
Similar to the CCT dataset, Snapshot Serengeti contains near-infrared images as well as RGB images and 
is annotated in the COCO Camera Traps format \cite{serengeti} and therefore is an easy addition to the CCT dataset.
In contrast to the CCT dataset, it contains also many RGB images from nighttime using incandescent lightning which 
proves handy for the training of NIR to RGB translation. 

\subsection{Subset Generation}
Since both datasets (CCT and Snapshot Serengeti) are substantially larger than processable for training, 
choosing a subset of those images is essential. The requirements for this subset strongly influence the performance 
of the models.

1. For both suggested models the input dataset needs to be divided into input- and output-domain, NIR and RGB.
2. To gain model performance in the main objective, which is colorizing NIR images of animals, 
choosing only images that contain animals is important.
3. Training with a variety of image locations proves to decrease the overfitting for the translation
and therefore a uniform distribution of the available locations should be approximated.
4. Since most NIR images are taken at night the network should not be influenced to solve the more difficult 
task of translating images from NIR night to RGB day. This can be archived by only allowing night images for both 
domains.

The 2., 3. and 4. requirements are all archivable by using the provided information from the COCO format and therefore 
are already defined before downloading a single image. 
While only choosing images with animals is done by a simple filter on the dataset before sampling the approximately uniform distribution 
of locations can be archived using a weighted sampling where the weight is the inverse of the location occurrences.
The COCO format also documents the time of recording. This can be used to only sample images from the night. 
Using the timezones and the geolocations where the datasets were recorded, individual time frames for each day of the year can serve as filters for night images.

Since the COCO format does not provide information about which item is a NIR- and which item is an RGB image \cite{caltech}, that information is not obtainable before downloading.
Because both datasets provide their NIR images with \textit{colored} logos, they are stored in an RGB image where the actual image section has equal values over all three channels.
Therefore a simple solution is the download the images and compare the three channels in a cropped version of the image. 

This whole process can be automated in the form of a mix between a rejection- and an importance sampler. It samples from the filtered dataset with weights by location, downloads the image and 
rejects a sample if the desired size of NIR- or RGB images is already reached. 
Finally, the produced subset can be stored in a compact format to archive reproducibility across systems.

\section{Proposed Methods}

For image translation, a mapping function $G: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$ shall be learned. 
In our case, $\mathcal{X}$ is the input domain of Near-Infrared images whereas $\mathcal{Y}$ is the output domain of colored RGB images.
For the training a dataset of unpaired images sets $X = \{\x \in \mathcal{X}\}$, $Y = \{\y \in \mathcal{Y}\}$ is given.
For the unpaired image translation, the mapping function must be learned without any existing $\x \in X$ for which $G(\x)=\y$ is known. 
Therefore supervised learning techniques are not applicable and unsupervised learning methods should be used.  

\textit{Generative Adversarial Networks} (GANs) provide a way of learning this function by declaring the objective that for a $\x \in \mathcal{X}$, $G(\x) = \hat{\y}$
should be indistinguishable from images out of $\y \in \mathcal{Y}$. GANs achieve this by splitting the training architecture into two networks: 
The \textit{generator} $G: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$ that learns the relationship between the two domains and the \textit{discriminator} $D: \mathcal{Y} \to \mathbb{R}$ which learns to 
classify possible images from $Y$ as "real" or "generated". 
Both networks optimize each other and play a min-max game: 
The generator tries to fool the discriminator into classifying the generated image as "real" and thereby learns to produce \textit{indistinguishable} images from $Y$.  
Additionally, the discriminator tries to detect generated images accordingly and also learns the features of the domain $Y$ by classifying those as "real". 

Although this method has already proven to perform well for image translation, %TODO source
it has issues keeping the content. GANs in general are not restricted in the training to mapping the actual \textbf{content} from the given image 
$\x \in X$ to the produced image $G(\x) \in Y$.
E.g. one could imagine that for a given $\y \in Y$ the mapping function which maps all $\x$ to a fixed $\y$ ($G(\x) = \y$) 
should perform exceptionally well considering its training loss because the produced image is always classified as "real". 
This case is called \textit{mode collaps} and can be weakened by adding additional structure to the training. 

In the following, we will concentrate on two options: 
1. Using a \textit{cycle consistency loss} which was introduced by Zhu \textit{et. al.} for the network \textit{CycleGAN} \cite{cyclegan_orig}
and 2. using a \textit{contrastive loss} which was introduced into this setting by Park \textit{et. al.} for the network \textit{CUT} \cite{cut}.

\subsection{CycleGAN}
CycleGAN is network architecture presented by Zhu \textit{et. al.} and introduces a \textit{cycle consistency loss} for image translations using GANs. 
The idea is that the translation between the two domains should be "cycle consistent" meaning that when we translate an image from NIR to RGB and then back 
to NIR both NIR images should be approximately equal. 
Mathematically this means if we have an additional function $F: \mathcal{Y} \to \mathcal{X}$ which is the approximately inverse of $G$ then for a $\x \in \mathcal{X}$, $F(G(\x)) \approx \x$
which is encouraged by a \textit{cycle consistency loss} \cite{cyclegan_orig}. We assume that if a $\x$ is recoverable from a $\y = G(\x)$ using $F$ then the content of $\x$
is preserved in $\y$ \cite{cyclegan_orig}.

\subsubsection*{Cycle Consistency Loss}
We can write this objective into a loss function $\mathcal{L}_{cyc}(G, F)$ which uses an L1 norm to encourage cycle consistency (\autoref{eqn:cyc}). 
In addition to the already mentioned \textit{forward cycle consistency}, CycleGAN also utilizes \textit{backward cycle consistency} meaning that for a $\y \in \mathcal{Y}$
also $G(F(\y)) \approx \y$ \cite{cyclegan_orig} should be.

\begin{equation}
   \label{eqn:cyc}
   \begin{aligned}
      \mathcal{L}_{cyc}(G, F) = \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{\x \sim X}\left[||F(G(\x)) - \x||_1\right]}_{\text{forward cycle consistency}} + 
      \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{\y \sim Y}\left[||G(F(\y))) - \y||_1\right]}_{\textit{backward cycle consistency}}
   \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

In addition to the L1 cycle consistency loss, Mehri \textit{et. al.} propose to use SSIM as a second cycle consistency loss \cite{mehri2019colorizing}. 
Contrary to the L1 loss, the \textit{structural similarity index} measures the differences between the images not by the absolute image intensity values but
by comparing two images based on luminance-, contrast- and structural similarity \cite{ssim}. 

Using measurements for luminance $l(\y_1, \y_2)$, contrast $c(\y_1,\y_2)$ and structure comparison $s(\y_1, \y_2)$ we can obtain the overall structural similarity 
index $SSIM(\y_1, \y_2)$ as multiplication of each component (\autoref{eqn:ssim}) \cite{ssim}.

\begin{equation}
   \label{eqn:ssim}
   \begin{aligned}
      SSIM(\y_1, \y_2) = l(\y_1, \y_2) \cdot c(\y_1,\y_2) \cdot s(\y_1, \y_2)
   \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The SSIM is obtained using a moving gaussian window over the image and therefore the SSIM difference between two images $\overline{SSIM(\y_1,\y_2)}$ is calculated as follows (\autoref{eqn:ssim_difference}).
We denote $\y_{1,j}$ and $\y_{2,j}$ as the image contents of the $j$-th local patch using the gaussian window whereas $M$ is the number of gaussian windows.    

\begin{equation}
   \label{eqn:ssim_difference}
   \begin{aligned}
      \overline{SSIM(\y_1,\y_2)} = \frac{1}{M}\sum_{j=1}^{M}1 - SSIM(\y_{1,j},\y_{2,j}) 
   \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Finally the cycle consistency loss $\mathcal{L}_{SSIM}(G,F)$ can be constructed using the differences in the SSIMs between the images (\autoref{eqn:ssim_loss}). 

\begin{equation}
   \label{eqn:ssim_loss}
   \begin{aligned}
      \mathcal{L}_{SSIM}(G,F) & = \mathbb{E}_{\x \sim X}\left[\overline{SSIM(F(G(\x)), \x)}\right] + \mathbb{E}_{\y \sim Y}\left[\overline{SSIM(G(F(\y)), \y)}\right] \\
                              & = \mathbb{E}_{\x \sim X}\left[\frac{1}{M}\sum_{j=1}^{M}1 - SSIM(\x_{1,j},\x_{2,j})\right] + 
      \mathbb{E}_{\y \sim Y}\left[\frac{1}{M}\sum_{j=1}^{M}1 - SSIM(\y_{1,j},\y_{2,j})\right]
   \end{aligned}
\end{equation}


\subsubsection*{Relativistic Adversarial Loss}
For both generators, adversarial discriminators $D_X$ and $D_Y$ are introduced where $D_X$ has the aim of distinguishing between real images 
$X$ and generated images $\{F(\y)\}$ and $D_Y$ for $Y$ and $\{G(\x)\}$.
For both, we apply a relativistic GAN loss namely \textit{RaLSGAN} \cite{mehri2019colorizing,rel_gan}. 
\autoref{eqn:ralsgan} demonstrates the RaLSGAN loss for the generator $G$ ($\mathcal{L}^G_{RaLSGAN}(G,D_Y,X,Y)$) and its discriminator 
$D_Y$ ($\mathcal{L}^D_{RaLSGAN}(G,D_Y,X,Y)$), the loss for $F$ and $D_X$ is defined analogous \cite*{rel_gan}.

\begin{equation}
   \label{eqn:ralsgan}
   \begin{aligned}
      \mathcal{L}^{D_Y}_{RaLSGAN}(G,D_Y,X,Y) & = \mathbb{E}_{\y \sim Y}\left[(D_Y(\y) - \mathbb{E}_{\x \sim X} D_Y(G(\x)) - 1)^2 \right] \\
                                         & + \mathbb{E}_{\x \sim X}\left[(D_Y(G(\x)) - \mathbb{E}_{\y \sim Y} D_Y(\y) + 1)^2 \right] \\
      \mathcal{L}^G_{RaLSGAN}(G,D_Y,X,Y) & = \mathbb{E}_{\x \sim X}\left[(D_Y(G(\x)) - \mathbb{E}_{\y \sim Y} D_Y(\y) - 1)^2 \right] \\
                                         & + \mathbb{E}_{\y \sim Y}\left[(D_Y(\y) - \mathbb{E}_{\x \sim X} D_Y(G(\x)) + 1)^2 \right]
   \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Identity Loss}
Lastly, the identity loss function has the aim of regulating the generator: 
If an image already looks like a colored RGB image, it should not be modified. 
This leads to the identity loss $\mathcal{L}_{identiy}$ (\autoref{eqn:identity_loss}) \cite{mehri2019colorizing}.

\begin{equation}
   \label{eqn:identity_loss}
   \begin{aligned}
      \mathcal{L}_{identiy}(G, F) = \mathbb{E}_{\x \sim X} \left[||G(\x) - \x||_1\right] + \mathbb{E}_{\y \sim Y} \left[||G(\y) - \y||_1\right]
   \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Full Objective}
All those four loss functions lead to an additive final loss function (\autoref{eqn:total_loss}) \cite{mehri2019colorizing}.
$\lambda$ and $\gamma$ are weights for the relative importance of the L1 cycle consistency loss and the identity loss. 

\begin{equation}
   \label{eqn:total_loss}
   \begin{aligned}
      \mathcal{L} = \lambda \mathcal{L}_{cyc} + \mathcal{L}_{SSIM} + \gamma \mathcal{L}_{identity}(G,F) + \mathcal{L}_{RaLSGAN}^G(G,D_Y,X,Y) + \mathcal{L}_{RaLSGAN}^F(F,D_X,Y,X) 
   \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{U-Net}
In praxis, both functions $G$ and $F$ are generation networks. In contrast to ResNet generators \cite{resnet} Zhu \textit{et al} used in the original CycleGAN \cite{cyclegan_orig}
U-Net generators \cite{unet} proposed by Mehri \textit{et. al.} are used, because they perform better in learning the color without affecting the image shape \cite{mehri2019colorizing}.
Additionally, U-Net generators also need less computational time compared to Resnet \cite{mehri2019colorizing}.

\subsubsection*{Optimizations}
\begin{enumerate}
   \item TTUR
   \item Spectral Normalization
   \item Decrease Cycle Consistency weight $\lambda$ over time 
\end{enumerate}
