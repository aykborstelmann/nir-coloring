\chapter{Conclusion}
In this thesis we develop, to the best of our knowledge, the first diffusion-based near-infrared colorization system.

We derive the system by applying diffusion-based gray-scale colorization \parencite{sbgm} and analyzing its weaknesses in our application context.
Further we leverage findings from the related research-field of NIR-RGB fusion \parencite{study-vis-nir-fusion} to exceed the performance of our baseline.
The influence of a hyperparameter for guiding our system and its influence on the similarity to the target distribution is discovered.
Two conditional guidance method for near-infrared colorization using diffusion models, the \textit{energy-guided} and \textit{loss-guided} sampling 
are examined, and we empirically show the superiority of the latter in our application context.
Last but not least we show the importance of the dividing the training dataset into near-infrared night images and RGB incandescent images
and provide tooling this task on the Serengeti dataset \parencite{serengeti}.

Finally, we compare our system to a strong GAN baseline \parencite{mehri}, and show its superiority in a quantitative and qualitative evaluation.
This improves tooling for wildlife researchers to enhance their understanding and interpretation of visual data obtained from NIR images.

\todo{Maybe move future work to end of \autoref{chap:evaluation-and-discussion}}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Invest more computational resources $\Rightarrow$ larger dataset, larger model 
    \item Sampling \& Training Speed
    \item Higher Resolutions
    \item More complex conditioning methods, e.g., inspired by \textcite{study-vis-nir-fusion}
    \item Better evaluation -- Calculate FID between Day \& Night separately
    \item Examine the content preservation $\rightarrow$ classifier accuracy ?  
    \item Investigate deterministic samplers such as ODESolver \parencite{sbgm} and DDIM \parencite{ddim}
    \item CycleGAN with High-Pass loss to keep content
\end{itemize}
